# Face Restoration

Steps to face restoration-

i. Training Data Gathering: Gather pictures of people's faces. 

ii. Training of Recognizer: Feed that face data to the face restorer so that it can learn.

iii. Restoration: Feed new faces of people and see if the trained face restorer model can restore the defective pictures.

## Overview Of This Project

Face Restoration Using Different Architectures:

i. Extra Trees 
ii. K Nearest Neighbors
iii. Linear Regression
iv. Ridge
v. Multi Output 
vi. Gradient Boosting 

Created model takes in the input data of people's faces and shows the results obtained using the above architectures.
