### What is facial emotion recognition?

Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions. The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that can recognize emotions as well. This technology is becoming more accurate all the time, and will eventually be able to read emotions as well as our brains do. 

AI can detect emotions by learning what each facial expression means and applying that knowledge to the new information presented to it. Emotional artificial intelligence, or emotion AI, is a technology that is capable of reading, imitating, interpreting, and responding to human facial expressions and emotions.
