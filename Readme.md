<a href="https://github.com/akshitagupta15june/Face-X/tree/master/Recognition-Algorithms">Recognition </ a> of faces by different algorithms and frameworks. Despite a variety of open-source face recognition frameworks available, there was no ready-made solution to implement. So In this project all kinds of algorithms are implemented and even with various operations that can be implemented in a frontal face. The available algorithms processed only high-resolution static shots and performed insufficiently.

<a href="https://github.com/Vi1234sh12/Face-X/tree/master/Facial_Biometric">Facial Biometric </ a> technology measures and matches the unique characteristics for the purposes of identification or authentication. Often leveraging a digital or connected camera, facial recognition software can detect faces in images, quantify their features, and then match them against stored templates in a database.

<a href="https://github.com/Vi1234sh12/Face-X/tree/master/Snapchat_Filters">Snapchat filters </ a> are certainly an integral part of what makes the social media platform and messaging app Snapchat unique and globally popular. Filters, or added effects, can be applied over images in a variety of ways before being uploaded to one’s social network for others to see. Geofilters allow users to alter a picture of a landscape, such as adding color to sky or turning day to night

<a href="https://github.com/Vi1234sh12/Face-X/tree/master/Face-Mask-Detection">Face Mask Detection </ a> Platform uses Artificial Network to recognize if a user is not wearing a mask.  The app can be connected to any existing or new IP mask detection cameras to detect people without a mask. App users can also add faces and phone numbers to send them an alert in case they are not wearing a mask. If the camera captures an unrecognized face, a notification can be sent out to the administrator.
