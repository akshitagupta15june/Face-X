# Generating Faces using GANs

DataSet: [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train the adversarial networks.

### Some samples of generated faces:

## Face Generation
In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.


## To Generate Faces:
1. Just run the script ```dlnd_face_generation.ipynb```
