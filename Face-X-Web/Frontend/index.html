                  Despite a variety of open-source face recognition frameworks available, there was no ready-made
                  solution to implement. So In this project, all kinds of algorithms are implemented and even with
                  various operations can be implemented in a frontal face. The available algorithms processed only
                  high-resolution static shots and have performed sufficiently.

                Meshery - Service Mesh Management PlaneInternet of Things has opened up a new avenue of research in
                the field of human activity recognition using wearable sensors. It provides an individual's valuable
                information regarding functional ability and lifestyle. Human activities are monitored automatically
                to provide personalized support to different individuals.

                  characteristics for the purposes of identification or authentication. Often leveraging a digital or
                  connected camera, facial recognition software can detect faces in images, quantify their features, and
                  then match them against stored templates in a database.</p>

                  the social media platform and messaging app Snapchat unique and globally popular. Filters, or added
                  effects, can be applied over images in a variety of ways before being uploaded to one’s social network
                  for others to see. Geofilters allow users to alter a picture of a landscape, such as adding color to
                  sky or turning day to night</p>

                  recognize if a user is not wearing a mask. The app can be connected to any existing or new IP mask
                  detection cameras to detect people without a mask. App users can also add faces and phone numbers to
                  send them an alert in case they are not wearing a mask. If the camera captures an unrecognized face, a
                  notification can be sent out to the administrator.</p>
